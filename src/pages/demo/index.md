**About** 
> "In order to prevent fragmented care by consulting medical specialists, primary care physicians are challenged with needing an influx of information to deliver the best care and make informed clinical decisions. In a quest to enable these primary care physicians better manage clinical information and facilitate this holistic view of their patient, an underlying problem was revealed. User interfaces proved to be a proxy concern, rather if clinicians had access to interoperable data from all the different data sources, the challenge for efficient user interaction would be eliminated entirely. With interoperable data, redundant tasks, like reentering patient information, where human errors can occur would no longer be an issue and data could be easily shared between systems. After witnessing endless outcomes that resulted in patient harm and inefficiencies within the health care ecosystem, the idea of Komet was born. Komet is a platform that attempts to harmonize all the different terminologies being used and generate a common model to enhance interoperable data."
