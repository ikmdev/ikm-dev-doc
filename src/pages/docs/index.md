### Volume 6: ANF Ballot
<a href="/Volume-6.pdf" target="_blank" class={styles.pdfLink}> PDF Version üìÅ </a>
<br></br>
This volume emphasizes the importance of using a standard normal form, like the Analysis Normal Form (ANF), for clinical statements to ensure they are understandable, reproducible, and useful across healthcare systems. ANF aims to address issues in data consistency and patient safety by providing a uniform model for documenting clinical statements, thereby improving data analysis, clinical decision support, and research. The goal is to achieve a high reliability organization standard in healthcare through precise and quality data management.
