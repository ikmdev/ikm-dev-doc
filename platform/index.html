This variation in formats, or knowledge standards, can result in patient safety consequences and impedes aggregation of data on a nationwide scale. </p><p>The loss of data integrity can significantly hinder public health agencies, research laboratories, and medical device innovators, and analytic capabilities. Additionally, this can also result in physicians making split-second, emergency treatment decisions without access to a patient’s complete history. More frequently, however, information loss leads to redundancies in patient care, such as re-ordering time-consuming and expensive diagnostic tests.</p><p>The challenges surrounding data quality and agility permeates throughout the entire healthcare ecosystem and require a transformative approach to harmonize data across the industry. It is not simply limited to how the data is presented to the physician but rather is the underlying path where data loses meaning and structure, presenting most acutely at the end of data journey.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-unique-approach">Our Unique Approach<a class="hash-link" href="#our-unique-approach" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Komet is a transformative tool that aims to fit within existing infrastructure to aid in the wide spectrum of clinical decision support functionalities with its impressive, high-degree of modularity. Through Komet, users will be connected to an Integrated Knowledge Management Ecosystem to develop a growing consortium of industry experts such as informaticists, clinicians, laboratorians, and strategists to build an open-source software solution that will enable lossless transformation of any and all disparate knowledge sources into a common model.</p><p>Komet aims to reconcile varying existing knowledge standards (e.g. LOINC, SNOMED, Local Codes) into a common data representation to improve interoperability and harmonization of data. Improvement of clinical decision support must come from the process of documenting care and is done through creating a highly reliable process for collecting and collaborating on the representation of healthcare data.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-tool-komet">Our Tool, Komet<a class="hash-link" href="#our-tool-komet" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Currently, aggregating, authoring, and editing multiple knowledge standards in the healthcare ecosystem is extremely difficult, highly subjective, and lacks coordination. Our tool, Komet, builds off of our integrated knowledge management platform and displays disparate knowledge standards in uniformity. This can aid in, for example, improving the accuracy of data transformation as test results move from analyzers to laboratory information systems to electronic health records and beyond. The micro changes to how data are packaged, transformed, and reconciled aids in downstream benefits to patient outcomes and improved information for policy decision-making.</p><p>Komet aims to aid in these areas for healthcare data coding:</p><ul><li>Creates Consistent Representation: Komet implements a consistent encoding of healthcare activity by using a common terminology data model that can increase the quality of analytical power performed on laboratory data.</li><li>Improved Code Mappings: The ability to improve the quality of the transformation of local knowledge to standardized knowledge and/or the transformation from one standard terminology to another standard terminology, thereby reducing the reliance on error prone, manual translation practices.</li><li>Reconciliations of Competing Guidance: Komet allows for direct, real-time updates to guidance for terminology standards, such as discouraged codes. This results in the flexible customization of terminology and the reduction of manual, complex, and inefficient terminology problems.</li><li>Maintaining Provenance: As data moves between different systems, Komet’s open-source, common model allows for proper version control and direct attribution to its original source.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="komets-benefits">Komet’s Benefits<a class="hash-link" href="#komets-benefits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>To Healthcare Providers<ul><li>Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are only as good as the data that they have to work with – by removing manual and error-prone processes required to determine equivalence between disparate devices, medications, and terminologies (e.g., SNOMED, RxNorm, LOINC), the Komet can help clinicians to receive timelier and more relevant CDS alerts</li></ul></li><li>To Laboratories<ul><li>Deciding which test code to use is often a manual, subjective, and time-intensive process. By harmonizing disparate laboratories terminologies (local codes, LOINC, SNOMED, etc.) Komet can provide laboratories with an clear and simple guidance for which test codes to select, thus reducing the amount time spent ensuring accurate translation and creating more confidence in a laboratory’s data as it moves between systems.</li></ul></li><li>To Life Sciences and Healthcare Companies<ul><li>Assigning the right encodings to your drugs and devices is a time-intensive, arbitrary, and expensive process that gets in the way of getting new products to market – Komet can help take the guesswork of assigning test codes to your devices out of the equation and allows for apples-to-apples comparison of real-world data in different formats. Spend less time on data quality and instead more time innovating.</li></ul></li><li>To Public Health Agencies<ul><li>Komet provides real determination of equivalence between different healthcare terminologies, which significantly speeds-up and increases the accuracy of public health analyses that lead to novel insights and in some cases, breakthrough discovery.</li></ul></li><li>To Regulators<ul><li>Komet enables a consistent way to collect and exchange high-quality data throughout pre- and post-market surveillance, increasing the reliability for policy decision making. The tool provides a source of truth for content that can integrate Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE) in real-time, enhancing the ability of public health reporting and surveillance.</li></ul></li><li>To Patients<ul><li>By helping health care organizations to harness the power of their data and strengthen their data integrity and agility, the use of Komet in healthcare organizations allows patients to better trust in the quality of care that they receive.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solutioning-for-you">Solutioning for You<a class="hash-link" href="#solutioning-for-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Komet utilizes and implements an enormity of modularity and flexibility through it’s open-source modeling for a broader adaption into a variety of contexts and situations. Komet aims to smoothly nest within existing infrastructure as an added layer to improve interoperability and harmonization of data within organizations and across the healthcare industry. Komet enables users and organizations connection to the larger Integrated Knowledge Management Platform where they can develop, contribute, and build on common solutioning collectively. Organizations can use and adapt Komet’s capabilities to suit their individual needs and problems.</p></article></div><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#a-system-wide-issue" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">A System-Wide Issue</a></li><li><a href="#our-unique-approach" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Our Unique Approach</a></li><li><a href="#our-tool-komet" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Our Tool, Komet</a></li><li><a href="#komets-benefits" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Komet’s Benefits</a></li><li><a href="#solutioning-for-you" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Solutioning for You</a></li></ul></div></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title"> </div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/platform">Platform</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/install">Install</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Docs</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/about">About</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023</div></div></div></footer></div>
